CoqEAL - The Coq Effective Algebra Library
==========================================

This repository contains a subset of the work that was developed in
the context of the ForMath european project (2009-2013).
This archive is split in four parts:

- theory (package  CoqEAL_theory), which contains  formal developments
  in algebra and optimized algorithms on mathcomp data structures.

- refinements (package  CoqEAL_refinements), which is a framework to 
  ease change of data representation during a proof.

- attic, files to adapt from previous versions of CoqEAL

- doc, tools for generating documentation out of local documentation.
