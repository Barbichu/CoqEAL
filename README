In order to compile this library, you have to set SSRPATH environment variable
to the root path of ssreflect on your machine, by a command like:

export SSRPATH=/path/to/ssr/root/folder

and then type `make` to compile.

Note: the makefile assumes you are using a dynamically linked version of the
ssreflect plugin. If this is not the case, you need to adapt the `Make` file.
