In order to compile this library, you have to set two environment variables:
  - SSRSRC should be the path of the ssreflect "src" folder
    (in which ssreflect.cmxs can be found).
  - SSRLIB should be the path to ssr theories (where the .v files are)

To set environment variables, you may use a command like:
export SSRPATH=/path/to/ssr/root/folder

and then type `make` to compile.

Note: the makefile assumes you are using a dynamically linked version of the
ssreflect plugin. If this is not the case, you need to adapt the `Make` file.
