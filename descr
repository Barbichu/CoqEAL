The COQ Effective Algebra Library

- contains the definition of rings with divisbility, bezout rings,
  principal ideal domains, elementary divisor rings.
- minors of matrices
- finitely presented modules of finite dimension
- many efficient algorithms to compute on matrices and polynomials,
  including smith normal form computation, Bareiss and Karatsuba
  algorithms
- a library for refining datastructures for unlocked or efficient
  execution, together with predefined refinements for natural numbers,
  integers, rationals, polynomials (list or sparse representaitons),
  matrices, and multivariate polynomials.
